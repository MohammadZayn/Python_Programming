'''Task #1
Difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python:

The = operator is an assignment operator. It is used to assign a value to a variable.
x = 5  # Assigns the value 5 to the variable x

The == operator is a comparison operator. It is used to compare two values for equality. It returns True if the values are equal and False otherwise. For example:
python Copy code
if x == 5:  # Checks if the value of x is equal to 5
    print("x is 5")

The ** operator is used for exponentiation. It raises the left operand to the power of the right operand. For example:

python copy code
result = 2 ** 3  # Raises 2 to the power of 3, result is 8

The ^ operator is a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. It performs the XOR operation on the binary representations of
the operands. The result is a binary number with bits set to 1 where the corresponding bits of either but not both
operands are 1.
For example:
python Copy code
result = 5 ^ 3  # 5 is 101 in binary, 3 is 011 in binary, result is 110 in binary which is 6 in decimal
The ^ operator is commonly used in contexts involving bitwise operations, such as cryptography, checksums, and low-level
data processing.
